ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Varun Vupparige ([Github](https://github.com/varunvupparige), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunvupparige/)), a System Controls Engineer at Nexteer Automotive. I develop control algorithms for Steer-by-wire systems. I completed my master's degree in Controls and Robotics from the University of California, San Diego. 

- ðŸŒ± I am a Controls and Robotics engineer with more than 3 years of industry experience in designing, developing, testing, and deploying more than five products across diverse sectors including Robotics, Medical, Automation, and Automotive. I'm passionate about developing and deploying real-world autonomous systems that contribute to the greater good!

- ðŸ”­ During my graduate studies, I worked at the Autonomous Vehicle Lab headed by Dr. Henrik Christensen on obstacle avoidance and overtaking using a Gaussian Process Motion Planner. ([AVL](https://github.com/AutonomousVehicleLaboratory/obstacle-overtaking-gpmp2))

- ðŸ‘¯ I developed a keen interest in product development while working in a Formula SAE team during my undergrad at RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru. My professional industry experience at Noccarc Robotics, an early-stage startup making ICU ventilators (featured in the book ([The Ventilator Project](https://www.amazon.com/Ventilator-Project-S-Srikant-Sastri/dp/9389104661)), in a fast-paced, innovation-driven environment has laid a strong foundation in product development. These experiences of solving diverse problems through computational and experimental approaches have deepened my understanding of building products and solving engineering problems 

- âš¡ As a masterâ€™s student specializing in Robotics and Controls, Iâ€™ve done projects exploring different motion planning, controls, trajectory optimization, stability analysis and state estimation techniques for safe autonomous systems. Please check out different projects from my GitHub profile!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Varun Vupparige ([Github](https://github.com/varunvupparige), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunvupparige/)),  graduate student focused on Controls and Robotics at the University of California, San Diego. I am graduating in June 2023, and looking for exciting full time opportunites in Controls and Robotics. 

- ðŸŒ± I am a passionate robotics engineer, who has more than 3 years of working experience in embedded software programming, designing electro-mechanical systems, and industrial prototyping, with a profound interest in Motion Planning and Controls.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Autonomous Vehicle Lab headed by Dr. Henrik Christensen on obstacle avoidance and overtaking using a Gaussian Process Motion Planner.

- ðŸ‘¯ I developed a keen interest in product development while working in a Formula SAE team during my undergraduate education at RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru. My professional industry experience at Noccarc Robotics, an early-stage startup making ICU ventilators, in a fast paced, innovation driven environment has laid a strong foundation in product development.These experiences of solving diverse problems through computational and experimental approaches have deepened my understanding of building products and solving engineering problems 

- âš¡ As a masterâ€™s student specializing in Robotics and Controls, Iâ€™ve done projects exploring different motion planning, control, trajectory optimization and estimation techniques for safe autonomous systems. Please check out my different projects from my github profile!
